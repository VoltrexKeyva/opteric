# Opteric
A standard and blazing fast Flags and Options Parser written in various programming languages.

## Why?
With the popularity of flags and options rising ever more with being used now almost everywhere especially in CLI (Command-Line Interface)s, this repository is born to write the initial implementation of the Flags and Options Parser (The JavaScript implementation) in various programming languages to help those who need a standard and blazing fast Flags and Options Parser.
